# portfolio
 My current website at [ericturner.it](https://ericturner.it)

While the 2021/2022 version of Gatsby was neat, I found it a pain having to setup a dev instance each time and rebuild the static site when I needed to make changes.
I also don't need a full stack website with a database for something as simple as a portfolio website. This website uses JSON files in /data/ and populates them using handlebars templating in a single-page html file.
