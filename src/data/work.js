        three buildings in our district to complete technology work orders which could include: troubleshooting a multitude of

        cardDetailedText: `Near the completion of my college career, I was more proficient in creating applications. I was
        promoted to this position to create custom-built applications that could integrate with our already existing student
        information system, asset manager, and ticketing system. These apps would vary between internal-use tech department
        tools, to full district-wide adoption. I built a custom API, and tracking system to be able to monitor and debug issues.
        Efficiency, ease-of-use and simplicity are my building blocks for my applications and I use these blocks to maintain
        data integrity for the tech department but give staff a great experience when they need to perform their operations.
